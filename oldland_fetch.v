/*
 * Interrupt handling:
 *
 * - I bit in the PSR:
 *   0: interrupts disabled.
 *   1: interrupts enabled.
 * - Interrupts are level triggered, if irq_in goes high and PSR[I] == 1 then
 *   we'll service the interrupt.
 * - There is a possibility for an IRQ to happen at the same time as another
 *   exception such as illegal instruction or memory abort.  All abort
 *   handlers are entered with PSR[I] == 0 and all other exceptions have
 *   a higher priority than IRQ - the handlers can reenable interrupts to
 *   service IRQS.
 * - When we're ready to process an IRQ we flush the pipeline to avoid any
 *   side effects (such as control register writes in particular) and other
 *   exceptions.  If we're stalling for a memory access or branch then the
 *   pipeline is empty.  Otherwise we issue a pipeline flush which is just
 *   a NOP but the writeback stage signals that the pipeline is flushed.
 *
 * Dealing with interrupts and debugging:
 *
 * - When debugging, if we're single stepping then when we resume executing
 *   and take an interrupt we haven't yet executed the instruction at PC, so
 *   the next instruction after servicing the interrupt should be PC.
 * - If we're running and take an interrupt then we've just executed an
 *   instruction, we need to return to the next instruction - either pc + 4 or
 *   the target of a taken branch.
 *
 * Exception Priorities:
 *
 * 1. Reset.
 * 2. Data abort.
 * 3. Software interrupt.
 * 4. Illegal instruction.
 * 5. Interrupt.
 * 6. Instruction fetch abort.
 *
 * With this scheme we should always process the exception for the instruction
 * that has made the most progress through the pipeline so returning from
 * that exception by re-executing the instruction or starting from the next
 * should order exceptions correctly.

 * that allows us to optimize call/ret as we don't need to calculate the
 * return address later and we already have it computed for the next
 * instruction address.
 *
 * The fetch unit does a partial decode of the instruction to determine
 * whether to stall or not.  Later on down the pipeline the stall is cleared
 * to continue new instructions.
